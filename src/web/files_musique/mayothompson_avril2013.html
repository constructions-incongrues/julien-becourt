      <strong><em>&ldquo;May i have more trouble in my monitor?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
      <p>une conversation avec Mayo Thompson &amp; Tom Watson<br />
        propos recueillis par Julien Bécourt, 19 avril 2013 / mai 2013</p>
      <p>Pas commode de résumer en quelques lignes la carrière de Red Crayola (renommé Red Krayola suite à des menaces de poursuites judiciaires de la marque de crayons de couleurs homonyme), l&rsquo;un des groupes les plus atypiques de l&rsquo;histoire du rock. Surgi au Texas au milieu des années 1960, le trio emmené par Mayo Thompson cultive déja un art de la dissonance et se distingue par sa manière sa manière de déjouer et de maltraiter systématiquement les conventions de la musique pop. Bien ancré dans l'avant-garde et la contre-culture de l'époque, le groupe revendique des accointances marxistes tout en épousant l'histoire de l'art à travers une réflexion esthétique, théorique et critique – tout cela illustré par une musique aussi barrée que bigarréee, qui désosse un par un les préceptes de l&rsquo;<em>American Way of Life </em>et du rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll <em>Hall of Fame</em>.</p>
      <p>Si les deux premiers albums sont encore ancrés dans un garage-rock imbibé de LSD, non loin des 13th Floor Elevators, la discographie du groupe devient à partir de 1975 un puzzle aux pièces éparses: les textes de Mayo Thompson, ironiques et grinçants, viennent envelopper des pop songs déconstruites à l'extrême, avec un détour par la case krautrock, le temps d'un album enregistré en 1983 avec Moebius et Conny Plank. </p>
      <p>Leur musique ressemble alors à un foutoir réfléchi, entre anti-rock démantibulé et free-jazz bruitiste, où les codes de la culture populaire convergent avec les théories de l'avant-garde. Si les deux premiers albums posent les jalons d'un psychédélisme &quot;rationnel&quot;, la discographie du groupe se transforme au fil des années en un véritable labyrinthe: du sommet expérimental <em>Coconut Hotel</em> en 1967 (refusé par leur maison de disques) jusqu'à <em>Fingerpainting</em>  - sans oublier <em>Corky's Debt to His Father,</em> l'extraordinaire album solo de Mayo Thompson en 1970 - , la route du groupe est chaotique et semée d'embûches. Considéré comme précurseur du punk et de la new wave, sa tête pensante Mayo Thompson se lie d'amitié à la fin des années 1970 avec Geoff Travis, le boss de Rough Trade. Producteur émérite, il enregistre en studio la plupart des groupes mythiques de l'époque. La liste est impressionnante: The Fall, Stiff Little Fingers, Cabaret Voltaire, Virgin Prunes, Kleenex, Felt, Blue Orchids, Monochrome Set… </p>
      <p>C'est pendant ces années londoniennes que Red Krayola devient un terrain d'expérimentation aux mille facettes où vont et viennent des membres des Swell Maps, d'Essential Logic, des Raincoats ou de Pere Ubu, aboutissant notamment à l'album <em>Soldier Talk</em>. La collision entre l'énergie sauvage de la scène punk et une distanciation plus cérébrale y trouve une adéquation inédite qui culmine dans sa collaboration au long cours avec le groupe d'art conceptuel Art &amp; Language (de <em>Corrected Slogans </em>en 1970 à <em>Sighs Trapped by Liars</em> en 2007). Avec ses assemblages de paroles non-sensiques et de rock dissonnant qui confine à l'abstraction, le groupe donne du fil à retordre à l'auditeur, que Thompson - en social-réaliste convaincu - encourage à la vigilance plutôt qu'à la passivité. </p>
      <p>Le groupe, qui n'a néanmoins jamais cessé son activité, prend un nouvel élan au milieu des années 1990 sous l'impulsion du label Drag City. Mayo Thompson y est alors entouré par Tom Watson (ex-Slovenly) et les artistes Albert Oehlen et Stephen Prina, ainsi que par la clique de Chicago - à savoir Jim O'Rourke, David Grubbs et John McEntire, évadés de Tortoise. C'est en duo que Red Krayola réapparaît aujourd'hui pour un concert exceptionnel en France. Accompagné de son fidèle acolyte Tom Watson, l'iconoclaste Mayo Thompson nous a livré de bon matin ses réflexions et ses aphorismes, soliloquant avec éloquence (et élégance) sur le fond sonore d'un percolateur à café. Certains de ses grommellements s&rsquo;étant révélés ininteligibles, nous avons cru bon de les schématiser par un point d&rsquo;interrogation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Are you going to play strictly cover versions of your first album <em>Parable Land of Arable Land</em>  tonight?</strong></p>
      <p>Mayo Thompson: We just gonna screw around with the songs of the first record, using especially some parts we used for the <em>Freak Out</em> section. We'll do something approximating the first album structure.</p>
      <p><strong>Guitar and computer?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : No, two guitars and that's it. With just a little bit of pre-programmed playback on the computer.</p>
      <p><strong>No proper drumming?</strong></p>
      <p>Tom Watson: Only electronic.</p>
      <p><strong>Does this record have a special meaning for you fourty years later?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : It remains. How can i put this? Music theory is exhausted. <em>Parable Land</em> and <em>Coconut Hotel</em> represent the last theoretical possibilities in music. And i continue to be interested in those ideas. I'm thinking about psychedelia also again. About states of mind. That record tells the basic shit on it. Everything is possible from that point of view. There are all the sounds, all the relations that were possible from musical sounds to noise, things that were noises and they weren't intended as music. It's a reinvestigation of that stuff, as we had come to the end of it. There's not much left to do. I'm sick of writing songs, personally. </p>
      <p><strong>Why is that the &quot;last theoretical possibilities&quot;?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Cause I don't hear anything new in music for the last 25 years!</p>
      <p><strong>Do you blame internet for postmodernism and permanent revivalist cycles?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Music is exhausted, it is polluted, it's everywhere around, you can't escape it.</p>
      <p>T. W. : It's forced upon you.</p>
      <p>M. T. : Whatever you're listening to or not, it's got you. It works your body. It alters your thoughts. You don't pay attention about the way it affects you. Just that part of it.</p>
      <p>T. W. : My feelings would also be that everything's been done before. We approximated it with <em>Fingerpainting </em>for example ever since. But not as a full performance. Also in relation to this particular performance, giving it a concept if you will, rather than goin in it as a rock show. Or playing songs from different records and interacting. This is a performance speaking more about the theatrical aspect. Last time we were here, we plaid our &quot;greatest hits&quot;. We've done the jukebox. A lot of times.</p>
      <p><strong>And you're sick of it...</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : It's not that we're sick of it, we wanna try something else. Please, something else.</p>
      <p><strong>Do you think everything's vanished forever or that's a new step? Do you think the music is definitely fucked-up?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : I don't have any hope in that measure. I don't have any expectations, i don't anticipate anything happening. I know if we may do that, it might happens. And apart from that, i don't see much else. The projective aspect of music that come with the content, the words, the order of the songs etc - that stuff don't change. Those ideas will correspond to what they come about. But the stuff we're trading in music… I've made actually very little music the last years in fact. I spend a lot of time <em>polemicize </em>it in fact and  i use music as mentality which…. (???) over the head</p>
      <p><strong>Red Krayola has always been a comment about the methods of production of music as much as music itself. It's been music commenting on music.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. :<strong> </strong>It's very nice, thanks to put it like that.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>You could adapt that rhetoric to today's state of music? Use it as a new paradigm?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : I can't think in terms of paradigms. Paradigm theory doesn't mean anything to me. It's just a convenient way of explaining the fact that you got a bunch of stuff that goes together. I don't have anything to <em>para,</em> i don't have any strategy at all.</p>
      <p>T. W. : And also the process for us to actually organize the performance, it works pretty well i think for us cause we work together and our connection is pretty close and it gave the proper shape of what we are going to do, a real sense of structure. There's no variation, we know what we're gonna do. The idea is there. So it's clear and it makes it less…</p>
      <p>M. T. : I think when you say &quot;You don't know what we gonna do&quot;, it means… </p>
      <p>T. W. : I don't know what MIGHT happen. I know what i'm gonna try to do. </p>
      <p>M. T. : It's different, it's not as predictable.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Being unpredictable is what we should expect from any valuable art or music. I wonder why everything is getting so expectable - and also acceptable…</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : The question is always the same, and Red Krayola embraced also this idea of repetition. We had hell of experiences that can not be repeated, in fact. Music can't be reproduced, it can't be tangled in a way that you can play it back in tracks. It's functional, it satisfies some desires, it's a social agent. We always experience that by itself anyways. We had nothing else to do. All we had to do is show up and play. And sociality. We ended up walking on the edgy side of the street. Not that we had any desire of this. Tonight, i'd rather be playing at the Olympia. And sleep in a four stars hotel.</p>
      <p>T. W. : Le Georges V. </p>
      <p>M. T. : Or le Ritz, maybe? (laughs) That would be my idea of more fun. More things would be animated, more relation would be involved. This is second-hand business.</p>
      <p><strong>I'd be interested to hear you about your involvement in the social aspects in music. You've chosen music as an art form, but you're operating simultaneously inside and outside the contemporary art business and the pop music business.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : That's the thing i don't understand, why what we do couldn't be popular? In France, or whatsoever. It trades with popular ideas and familiar ideas, that tries to extent to novelty. I had a discussion about novelty. It depends on being onto some kind of grammar, and in our music, there's no grammar, there's no rules, there's no text, there's just semantics and expressionism. Jim O'Rourke for example talks about &quot;communicating&quot;, but i don't think he thinks about his music in terms of &quot;communicating&quot;. Perhaps his music communicates something, but it's not designed for this communication. It's straightforward expression. Our music is based on an understanding of basic ideas, of where we are, now. This is a simple idea. But the difficulty is to familiarize with those sounds. We're not very friendly, we don't want to do music for the thing it does, the &quot;feel good&quot; thing.</p>
      <p><strong>As opposed to a stimulus that would be a response to a certain feeling: being happy or being sad, waking up in the morning or dancing at night. It's all functional.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : It's the people music, the usual.<strong> </strong>That's why i don't listen to music at all. I only play it, but i barely listen to it, besides classical. I'm not necessarily part of the social movements that are informing this pop thing. I don't have to get away with those problems. Like in art world, you have lot of people talking about networking. Whoever thought of networking. There's never been anything but networking. There's a resistance working when we go home and (?) .  The functional aspect it not mind to be. I can only prevent certain things, like fascists might not enjoy this music (?) </p>
      <p><strong>[ 11:46  --- ??? ]</strong></p>
      <p>T. W. : There's some kind of challlenge.</p>
      <p>M. T. : There won't be any question of Paul D. Ryan <em>(homme politique américain, membre du Parti Républicain, NDR)</em> flexing and listening to Rage Against the Machine. Nor Red Krayola, for sure.</p>
      <p>T. W. : Not on purpose anyway. <strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>You were saying earlier there's no strategies, but your music has always been about some kind of conceptual tactics.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Yes, there's definitely some tactics involved. Music is tactical by itself. But it's always contended, it's not driven by anything. Red Krayola is a platform if you like. It has no ideological aspect. Or very vague ones: rich, famous. (laughs) That's about as far as we go.</p>
      <p>T. W. : I think also we actually have fun playing together in many places. It's an enjoyable experience. We've had rehearsals, but not anything we could put on record. Usually we capture a jam. A lot of things actually came out of that, an event - and then we build from that.</p>
      <p>M. T. : Our first tour in Japan, the basis of Amor &amp; Language were improvised in one afternoon. Tonight, we're gonna play our songs from the first album.</p>
      <p>T. W. : It's a lot of fun to keep it in a small context, it changes the presentation aspect and it's important.</p>
      <p>M. T. :: I'm not sure about playing in a church, tho. I'm very unhappy about that, actually. Our music is everything but sacred. Ideally, we intended like to drop a bit of acid on sugarcubes and distribute them to the audience with a cup of coffee, as if it's the blood of Christ. And then the show begins! (laughs) We drink the coffee afterwards, and open it wide, play the first freak outs! The great transubstantiation! Jesus Christ! But we can't make that joke anymore, cause that's a real church.</p>
      <p><strong>The priest might join you!</strong></p>
      <p>TW: I wonder. But if it changes the aspect of what it is, it's not funny anymore.</p>
      <p>MT: If you play with us, you won't be a priest anymore.</p>
      <p><strong>The spiritual side is absent of your music?</strong></p>
      <p>T. W. : It doesn't wind/bring up, somehow.</p>
      <p>M. T. : Moving emotional movement. People are talking about music instead of emotions. It takes the same receptors than emotions. And people react to it by association. I just want to leave all the legends behind. I don't want to specify the parts that have to compute, how they got together.</p>
      <p><strong>[ 17:00 --- ??? ]</strong></p>
      <p>T. W. : I think also tonight, we'll be in the process of just serving the songs. We're performing the songs, so that the music is almost transparent to the way the songs are structured, the lyrics, and the way songs are put together. It's not about the show. </p>
      <p>M. T. : That part takes care of itself, i think. There's a back up. There will be some aspects that people are not very enthusiastic about, they're not gonna jump in there: oh, very well, they're goin wild or anything. But we'll see what happen.</p>
      <p>T. W. : I guess we don't know.</p>
      <p>Everything turns on &quot;who's there&quot;on how everybody feels. You know what i mean? If there's a bad vibe in the room, then we might pick it up. Spades!</p>
      <p>T. W. : It's funny, cause we're listed as entertainers on our passports. Sometimes there's a bit of tension that builds in the performance but it's not necessarily entertainment. We're interacting, and sometimes it's good, sometimes it's like we walk in another direction…</p>
      <p>18:30</p>
      <p>M. T. : We come up to people with our very own ideas about life and all that stuff.<br />
        Music means whatever it means, I can't control that. There's some things people don't think about, and it ends up in this alternative pop ghetto, as if there was a specific social alternative. But all music is an alternative. It's all build in the same mold. </p>
      <p><strong>Like coffee is an alternative to tea…</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Everything is an alternative to something else. Life is an alternative to death.<br />
        You know Jacques Attali's<em> Bruits</em>? That's not my thing, i don't copt with those ideas. I don't like very much these ideas neither. I own Deleuze but i sold my Guattari. There was a turn. Music by itself is not a functional thing. I don't know what it is. I like it as an abstract idea. I just like the idea, that's it. I like the stuff it's made of, and i understand the relations to it.</p>
      <p><strong>Well, i guess music is a stimulus of some sort. And it has the meaning you put into this stimulus. But the market has connected the stimulus to economy and consumption instead of meaning. You've always been critical about the consumer values… It was a political commitment in the sixties and seventies.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : We made some kind of left-wing discourse, yes. We had some involvement with that, we tried to take that idea. If we are socialists? Of course. We practiced some social realism on <em>Kangaroo </em>for example. On the other hand, I thought people would enjoy the coldness of it. The abstractness. But this music does also function on a popular level. </p>
      <p><strong>Do your lyrics pop up in the same process than music? Through association of ideas?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Occasionally, we decide of a topic and we write a song about it. Or a mood, or something like that. It's like an exercise to try to generate the environment for those things. I don't know what it is, all i know is our music doesn't sound like other people's. It's not put the same way. When people hear it, they 're like &quot;What s that?&quot;, they don't remember having heard something like that. I like this trouble.</p>
      <p>T. W. : And there's certainly different phases. Different incarnations with different people who have contributed. Our voices have been heard in different states, in different stages.</p>
      <p>M. T. : You have to ask yourself: why do people on regular basis play a certain type of music? Why would they bother with us?<br />
        It refuses to smooth out. It remains the problematic point.</p>
      <p>T. W. : It refuses to fizzle out. </p>
      <p><strong>What keeps you going, then? Why not just stop music and expose your theory, your ideas? </strong><br />
        M. T. : One reason i continue to make music is that…</p>
      <p>T. W. : You can't help it.</p>
      <p>M. T. : No, no, it's not that at all! One of the reason is because of  this art business, right? There's always been this art connection with Red Crayola, we're promiscuous with that category. There was a time where we didn't play in art galleries deliberately, cause it was a deadly association to be in art. If you see in Wikipedia, everything's explained. It's not true! I never went to art school. I was a history student for a while. When I started to make music in a way to participating in the conversation with those people i know who are artists, as significant, even if we're not playing the same game. We're allowed to stand really next to art, without necessarily compete with. Like Martin Kippenberger. But now, i'm dead tired of maintaining those differences, i'm ready to grasp all those contradictions as a matter of fact. I know it's gonna be difficult.</p>
      <p><strong>Conceptual art used to be some kind of a critical discourse. It had something to say about the state of economy, about the state of the art itself. Right now, it seems more like a planned strategy in order to make a career.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : So what? Why not? What's wrong with that? This is contradictory, cause there's no pure artists. It makes a contradiction of what actually is. Get hold of one and make a mess, and develop it. When i say mess, i just mean articulate what means to be articulated, and what not. If your identity depends on… If what one does is an expression of one's identity, and an extension of one's identity (…)<br />
        You can't just look at it coldly or with a cool eye.</p>
      <p><strong>I'm not that romantic…</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : I was a romantic. To a certain extent, i remain, i have certain ideals which can be subsumed. (…) If your talking with my wife, she's australian. She seems encooked (?) with all those ideas of romanticism. That there's some duty, and honor, and history and all those kind of things. I got all the same things. From the Texas down to Australia. </p>
      <p>T. W. : Don't mess with Texas! (laughs)</p>
      <p>M. T. :  It takes a lifetime to get over conditioning. I'm 69 and i'm just starting to get rid of my early conditioning. I'm no longer worried about all that.<br />
        Hannah Arendt had an idea about careerism: &quot;There's good career, and there's careerism &quot;. (…) Beady eye, bastard smoot (?). There's some people who act like bastards to get anything they want, and there's some people who are nicer about it.<br />
        29:00<br />
        That's a bit rude. We're all cracked in the same nut. Existential. You gotta get up to get food, shelter and all those things. There's no way out outside the existential party. And to make litterature about the existential part, maybe that was a good idea.<br />
        (30:00)<br />
        I'd say the difficulty is you can develop performative relationship to refuse… It's more fun to accept some and refuse some. Rather than be known for refusing everything, be a purist or that kind of stuff. There's no such thing.  I got no plan, I got clean hands around here.<br />
        Why do i persist doing music? (temps de réflexion) That's what i do. There's nothing else.</p>
      <p>T. W. : I want to bring up from my experience working with other groups. My opinion is part of the way you're able to keep on working with others on your own music. Somehow having the ability  to be a good producer, with advice to someone lyrically or in studio situation. It's a talent that's even more than writing your own music. You can perceive it from other angles, have good ideas, that keeps that expansive view of how things can work. Maybe i keep this interesting enough.</p>
      <p>M. T. : If we weren't musicians, we wouldn't do certain things, like sleeve, boxes, tape up, produce, marketing records. I swept course (?).<br />
        There's all those things you can do. Someone asking me to manage the Smiths? Yes, please. Definitely. That's a wide business. that's part of the reason why i continue doing music. The business part keeps me getting interested.</p>
      <p><strong>In the early 80's, you were producing plenty of punk and postpunk bands in London.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : In the seventies, i found out that Britain really had music. America doesn't give a fuck about music. America's got too many cultures, too many religions, there's no harmony. Music doesn't exist. Being a producer is like being a tree. It's someone that you are grimly.</p>
      <p><strong>I'm interested by you nomadic experience. Like with David Thomas from Pere Ubu for example. The contextual and social environment. Does it have an influence on your work? </strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Absolutely.</p>
      <p><strong>Cause David Thomas, that i interviewed last year, is affirming that only the birthplace is important.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : That's not true. He's militant about it<strong>. </strong>He's deciding which bits are not him. How can you separate those things? There's no way out of it. I am me where i am, with certain contingent relation to others depend on him as well. He makes choices, quite like all of us. Sometimes we prefer people don't think, so he goes away. David is probably the most articulated writer in the world. That's the history of David Thomas: six foot tall, 300 hundred pounds man, very enthiously intelligent, does great interviews. But he doesn't like to be liked from below. And doesn't like to be photographed from below. And don't crush the wives.<br />
        (36:05)</p>
      <p><strong>Red Krayola has an opposite angle.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Yes, it's a compliment. If Red Krayola could export and develop, we'd play two big shows in NY and make million dollars like they do. But i don't think it makes so much difference.<br />
        David has some core beliefs, and i don't share them. He's a Christian, he's a Jehovah witness. That is important to him and that explains a lot of his attitude. When we did his first record, he asked me to do a joke about manda hole of Minerva (????)<br />
        He wouldn't have iconography. He saw that economically. I introduced some other icons into his world.<br />
        He wouldn't <br />
        (…???…)</p>
      <p><strong>It's a heresy.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. :  From that guy's point of view, it's heresy. I was raised as a catholic and had a catholic education, that seemed like war of the world. But i'm not a catholic anymore. </p>
      <p><strong>Are you an agnostic?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : I don't bother. I don't even bother to doubt. I don't care! (laughs)<br />
        I understand that this rock movement is gonna burned up in the sun in X-billion years and none of it makes music.<br />
        It's important to us to do it the way we wanna do it now. That's what counts. What happens later? What happened before? I don't care. Earth, now. </p>
      <p>T. W. : You are here.</p>
      <p>M. T. : When it was time to get on, i went on. I'm not scared. That works. We joke about it but i think it's true. We could go on stage with two guitars with no strings on and pull it off.</p>
      <p><strong>In a Fluxus kind of way?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : I'm glad you mention that. Fluxus suggests that music is finished and all is left is to make some jokes. Cage's music is the end of everything. It also expresses the poverty. Not the richness of the idea, but the poverty of it. I see it slightly differently. I have hope in systems. I think Cage is important. But he's religious. Rock is not my religion.</p>
      <p><strong>Are you a materialistic?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : All day long. And a physicalist until the end. (laughs)</p>
      <p>____________________</p>
      <p><em>[ One month later, a telephone conversation ensues. ]</em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong><em>Kangaroo</em></strong><strong> album was turned into a karaoke in a recent exhibition of Art &amp; Language.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : It's not really karaoke. They put the words up there and it flashes. I wish we could put on a real Red Krayola karaoke machine, that would be fun.</p>
      <p>T. W. : To build an actual machine.</p>
      <p>M. T. : Art &amp; Language is slowly granted to appreciate they have a rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll history now. They're drifting to a direction and i'm drifting to another. I would start making art. Then we'll see what happen with this association.</p>
      <p>T. W. : That's another relationship to create certain momentum to keep the band going in a single one direction. Like lyrics provided by art &amp; language, and music by Red Krayola.</p>
      <p>M. T. : There's a sentence of Cage, which really impressed us early on. He said: &quot;<em>Part of where we're goin is across the street</em>&quot; (without saying what was the other part) - which keeps us on transdimensional and transcendental aspect - everything involves interpretation, you can't get out of the transcendence in fact - but you're not going anywhere. When i'm going across the street, when i'm partly doing anything - that's completely doing anything. It's just you, what it is, what can be done. Handle with that material, that would be the attitude. Maybe in contrast with Fluxus, the jokes with the machines and then you make a lip and you hear it as music, you listen to it as musical sounds. Sure it is, but it's not very interesting music, it's not very good music. (laughs) I'm not interested in it. (…) Hefty,  I'd be interested of the first time in the process of watching the monees of falling the timb (?).  But having seen it once, i've been sneaking suspicious. That's the thing it is. Repeating. I don't see how to do it.</p>
      <p>T. W. : What about the freak outs? Is that music?</p>
      <p>M. T. : No, some of it is music.</p>
      <p>T. W. : i mean &quot;musical&quot;.</p>
      <p>M. T. : It is musical, and it is made under the (43:00) music. It's freakin fall (?)<br />
        It's actually expressionism. Music is an engagement, a funny engagement. (44:00) But normally, you  don't make music.</p>
      <p><strong>The &quot;freeform freak out&quot; term comes from Frank Zappa?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : This has been a story, we were sitting in an artist office and we were talking about …..<br />
        It settled down in one evening and writing a song called … &ldquo;Madonna&rdquo;. And two days later, we were hearing on the radio lady Madonna.<br />
        It's the ether, dude (???)<br />
        You french people got Descartes and you got Pascal.<strong> </strong>Pascal disciplines Descartes and Descartes disciplines Pascal.<br />
        Descartes reminds Pascal? you don't know. You don't know for sure. I don't know what i'm knowing.<br />
        There's a difference in terms of systematics, there's a lot of people with a lot of systems. Someone saying &quot;Yeah, this works!&quot;. I don't think of music in an algorithmic way. It's not a solution for something, it's a solution for itself.</p>
      <p><strong>Ain't you interested in mathematics?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : I'm interested in mathematics, but the entire mathematics wouldn't be a problem, not as they necessarily commit. All those constraints. Let's take something as simple as dance music, a formula. You got a music at 120BPM, so the body know where it is and respond the according way. It has a purpose. So we take that idea and alienate it. So it doesn't really have rule (root?) that is suggested to it. It really is just another idea, next idea. </p>
      <p><strong>Whatever their use, algorithms are at the core of electronic sounds.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Absolutely, there are those harmonious relations. Pythagorus had a good press agent. He's credited in a lot of stuff. This pythagorian relation to songs, i don't like them. And i don't like the people who trade it. I find it a cheap crutch. Pentatonic scale is as bad as it really is. As complicated as it really is. There's good and bad. You know, Cage was a buddhist. There's this pathetic relationship to the world. Whenever he gets into that buddhist thing, it makes my teeth cringe. I'm like, fuck off. But there's a logic to that. There's no wrong way. It has embedded just him. It's his solution, you know. It's a way like another to get you through the life.</p>
      <p>I don't bother to doubt, cause i'm way too busy with other things i can't doubt. There's no reason to doubt that i'm with real people and that i  am weak, all those other kind of things that gets me in trouble, being sorry i made up the terrible mess and horrible mistakes and stuff like that. Only those historical and biological facts about me, those are preoccupying me and shape the way i deal with other kind of things, including that idea of rhythm (?)<br />
        (51:27)<br />
        Cage likes all of those things and i have excluded all of them. But function terms. It's the same game. Language. Understand how things relate to each other. </p>
      <p>It's a straitjacket.<br />
        All things come from that. How do you get this expression of it. I can't believe the text alone.<br />
        Break through another world.<br />
        I started up in the music business as a perfectionist.<br />
        One mistake and that's perfect.<br />
        54:00</p>
      <p>T. W. : Deliberate mistakes, imperfections.</p>
      <p><strong>Someone reaching perfection would be an asshole, for sure.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : (laughs)<strong> </strong>I promise you not to be an asshole. I can't be, really, seriously. <strong></strong><br />
        Give up on perfection, give up on utopia. Give up on those things.</p>
      <p>T. W. : There's maybe a difference between perfection and… enlighthnment or sense of inner peace.</p>
      <p>M. T. : Let's take apart the notion of …<br />
        Hitler was kind of a modernist, let's face it. (laughs)</p>
      <p>T. W. : Good example, really good example. He was kind of an asshole, i guess.</p>
      <p>M. T. : He didn't even know it, tho. He believed in his own thing. When everybody believes in his own thing, you gotta have to worry. Particularly if they're in charge.</p>
      <p><strong>You music is also about the failure of modernism, or even postmodernism. The failure of everything.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Kant had this idea about the object: the object is a failure for the producer cause it's not what the consumer has in mind and a failure for the consumer cause it's not what the producer had in mind making. Not quite perfect. That fact, in terms of productivity and distribution. I'm no idealist, cause there's ideal and there's a projectory (…) asymptot. They never reach ---- ?</p>
      <p><strong>It's like a wall you're bumping into...</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : But you don't reach the wall! you bump into this place, but you can't reach that place.</p>
      <p>In music, you can express this. It's a non-tangible experience. It's just like a moment.</p>
      <p>The functional aspect of music, it's the psychedelic effect.</p>
      <p>Crazy or irrational. There's this notion of irreality and surreality. It exists and it may be relevant, depends on the situation. I'm really interested in this whole psychedelic thing.</p>
      <p>What's funny is that's a term that was branded, by certain groups and at a certain time.</p>
      <p>The 13th Floor Elevators was like acid. You were supposed to listen to that record and you would get high. What is psychedelic music? It would be a music that is efficient to a psychedelic trip. An altered state of being.  If you had drug experience, you might recall... It would be my association based on that: all music is psychedelic. It's not really an analogy, it's just that: an altered state of being.</p>
      <p><strong>But there's also a spiritual side attached to the notion of psychedelia, don't you think? For most of the users, it's like a mystical experience. I mean, when you read Aldous Huxley, Jung…</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. :  I don't think the constructs that we make for ourselves upon with our senses leads to the world in spiritual terms, like God or whatever. I don't think there's anything wrong or strange about that. I just don't subscribe.</p>
      <p><strong>You're not interested in metaphysics?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. :  Not so much. That doesn't mean i'm a narcissistic. (laughs) I'm not just very spiritual, that's all. I've always had an ambivalent attitude towards faith. Except i had an epiphanic moment, when i was 14, i was really transported. But that was in a church and by the time i get outside to get fresh air, the incense went off and it was ok again. (laughs) It answers to something i don't question, i dont ask anymore. It occurs to me that it begins the question of meaning, right in content: the meaning of death, the meaning of life - all of those things all apply, which should do one's best to make things meaningful the way they make sense to one; everyone has the absolute right to properly know where you're stopping at. There's an idea of destiny outside of behaviorism, outside of religion as well, it's a question of genetics. It's all programmed, it's all set, isn't it? My faith for told in my very begging is i am fold before your very eyes, it slowly dies. (laughs) </p>
      <p><strong>This sounds quite fatalistic…</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : I don't know but I admit it's highly opaque. (laughs) I don't mean to sound mystical. I have faith in people. I enjoy meeting you.</p>
      <p><strong>That's reciprocal. But on my opinion, psychedelia doesn't work very well with rationality…</strong></p>
      <p>T. W. : For us, this is all very deliberated.</p>
      <p>M. T. :  Psychedelism is a characteristic of existence, that your mind is expanding and that you're always in a psychedelic state. <br />
        There's something about psychedelism you can experiment with psychotropic drugs, but that's not what i'm talking about.<br />
        I'm talking about a lifestyle. Magic music, that can put you in a trance. You see people transported. I had come off stage and seen friends of mine really had a good time. Tears of joy, that sort of stuff. I know that there's music than can affect people.</p>
      <p>T. W. : Emotional interaction.</p>
      <p>M. T. : It just doesn't have that effect in general. Therefore, my conclusion is that the more regular the experience, the less like a musical experience. It's more like information, just like a stimulus. A bump that gets you stimulated. And the way they bring'em together is abstract. The way they hang together in their own right. You got a music aspect that can't always be explained. You have to listen to it. There's maybe this idea of attentive listening, not background music.</p>
      <p>T. W. : Or it's not just like &quot;get out on the dancefloor&quot;.</p>
      <p>M. T. : I have objectif belief. I believe that this is music, in an optic of contemplation. It sounds like i'm claiming that i do something that nobody else does. In fact, i'm not. No, I'm claiming that i'm doing something that everybody else does. I'm claiming we all do exactly the same thing. That musicians are doing exactly the same thing. I don't like <strong>nominal idealism (musical idioms?)</strong>, i don't like cultural positivism. I can't stick to that. I don't want to be part of it. I don't want the cheerleading thing. I'd just rather make trouble. And synthesize everything.</p>
      <p><strong>You still want to make trouble?</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Yes. We generate relations. You and i, we're on a topic to each other.</p>
      <p><strong>Some people are just not interested. It doesn't disturb or arouse them. They're indifferent. What's lost is the communal experience of music. It has been replaced by a specific function at an individual level.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Fair enough. I agree with you completely. I knew some guy in Texas who studied alpha rhythms and made music that generated alpha waves in the brain. And he was thinking of music as a therapeutic aspect. Including  these possibilities.</p>
      <p><strong>A psychedelic freak? </strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Not at all, quite the contrary. A very rational, scientific guy. Thinking of music doing certain kind of effects. Our music does have a function. It has the function to do the other things that other pieces of music keep in the shadow, which is is to reflect the conditions in which they are made. To stand as a resistant relation to be exhausted. The usual ways, let's say. So that conversation&rsquo;s pun (?)This experience&rsquo;s <strong>spun.</strong>(?)</p>
      <p>T. W. : You made a comment earlier that make me think of that now. That in some way Red Krayola has been like a commentary on other music or maybe just a comment on other musics. Cause there's a relationship: it's not trying to copy, it's just reacting to. It's a reaction. It's not like we're in a bubble and we don't hear anything.</p>
      <p>M. T. : Did you ever watch the serie &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot;? You see the back of 3D heads in a movie theater sitting in the front row: they're watching the movie and you're watching the movie. Two of them are robots and one of them is a human,  three idiots sitting there and and they're making stupid non-sense comments and secretive jokes on sci-fi B movies. The rest of the world is broad into it. That's what we do. That would be the distinction. The whole world is represented in that sort of way. </p>
      <p><strong>This is related to &quot;mise en abîme&quot;, postmodernisme, poststructuralism, deconstruction, the meta aspect…</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : Yes, Jacques Derrida. But we're in the next step, i'd hope so. Now I'd be happy to see the back of the postmodern figures and make jokes about it. Pynchon books sounds more and more like Oswald Spengler, you got that day by day: the end of civilisation. Where's the authority? How we gonna have values? How not to be worried? He's attached to people thinking about it in their own way. He doesn't know anything the way it gets, he doesn't how to think in a way, he thinks he's not thinking the way he should be thinking about. So he sees the end of the world.</p>
      <p>T. W. : Where do we go? New world?</p>
      <p>M. T. : Maybe that means we'll get some place else. That would be nice. Get something fresh. Fresh forms.</p>
      <p><strong>Maybe that's just a transitional phase rather than the end.</strong></p>
      <p>M. T. : What do we want to be transitive out of that? What do we want to maintain? Do we have the right to be intransitive? Does it carry over? Transition means there's something  we gonna leave behind, what we gonna throw at? I'm not sure there's anything we can throw at. I think we can rearrange relationship, the structures. Red Krayola is funny cause there's the structure of the organisation and there's the tones structuring that brings to it, all the individual players into it, that's a structure as well.  So that's a structure out of a structure. It's a set of sets of sets of relations. It's something you have to take care of. In terms of authority but also in terms of what have been done. But other things just take care of themselves. That's what we are trying to do in music. Things that take care of themselves.</p>
      <p>T. W. : It will be nice also playing the first record, cause it will take care of themselves as performances.</p>
      <p>M. T. : We don't have any icons. We use icons around there, but we don't like icons.</p>

      <p>Conversation téléphonique avec Mayo Thompson, 15 jours plus tard.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>What about L.A.? Do you play with other people?</strong></p>
      <p>No, i keep it to myself. I don't play anymore with other people. I don't like standing on stage in a club in front of a bunch of people i know. I just want to play to strangers. I gave up on public psychology, behaviorism and this kind of thing.<br />
        (…) <br />
        Empiricism and abstraction are in the world. It's real.<br />
        I'm a materialist and a strong physicalist. There's one guy philosopher i like, he describes himself as ontological physicalist and a sentential dualist. It kind of sums up the problem. I got interested in that when i was studying intentionality and meaning. A community of speakers or a community of users and a possibility of established means, things like that. <br />
        (…)<br />
        More trouble, please. Can i have more trouble in my monitor?</p>
      <p><strong>What are your current projects, present, future?</strong></p>
      <p>I'm currently working on replaying an opera written in 1984. Art &amp; Language wrote the libretto and i wrote the music . We performed a section of it last year. We did two things, actually. It's about Victorine Meurent, Monet's model for the Olympia painting. She was also a painter in a reactionary style, she didn't like modernism. She was also a musician, she plaid guitar, and she was also an actress. The twist is: maybe she's the killer. Is there a killer?<br />
        It's got a ballet, it's a proper opera. I'm determined making that thing as a low budget 3D underground movie. I'm writing the piano score right now. It will be done in the next couple of years. I met a few people in Hollywood, we'll see what happens. </p>
      <p><strong>You gonna direct it?</strong></p>
      <p>Oh, you bet! What i'm not gonna do is to star in it! (laughs)</p>
      <p><strong>You also collaborated with the electronic musician Philip Quehenberger, from Vienna.</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, i love that guy. He takes  techno to a new meaning. And with the drummer of Fuckhead. It's coming from viennese actionism. It's like a communal thing. DIY. Industrial. Noise.</p>
      <p><strong>Are you interested in noise music?</strong></p>
      <p>Jacques Attali has written a book called <em>Noises</em>. Either you agree it or not, with the word noise, you usually sums up with a sort of index where he shows up. There are some comparisons or views or something like that. He has the most explanatory power. His explanation subsume ours. You raise a lot of questions. Let's see if we can proceed to them. I'm gonna talk about noise in particular and specific terms. Not in a lumpy sort of way. Noise is an interpretation of a sound, to call a sound noise, it means that's not information for me. I see noise as relation of information theory. The assumption that is noise, it also means what we know from the nature of sound is that is present. Noise is always present, and it has to be dealt with, somewhere in the brain. This is information all the time. And we're tuning good or tuning bad, focusing the ears on those kind of things that are relevant to our existence and to the moment. Music is sound, that's mayhem organised with intent, let's say that. If i choose to to make noise on my guitar while i'm playing music, which part of that sound is fairly noise? Derek Bailey would have known what's noise and what's a sound. If i have a recording studio with fifty people making sounds, some of them are proceeding on the premice they're making music - playing drums, piano, guitar… - and some others are just making sounds. But shouldn't be all that aggregated? It is statistically probable than some person want to interfer in those relations, and therefore from their point of view it's information, but from the point of view of the whole, it's noise. So they introduce noise into the system. Complicate it, according to metry. I'm fully aware of the bruitist tradition, but i'm not a proponent of it. That man made an instrument. It's called noise music, i suppose, because he adjust himself to that which has been excluded. The relation to instrument to making music. I do not provide anything, i didn't the net of noise music on the grounds of that think &quot;oh, dear, it's excluded and i want it to be more democratic&quot; or anything like that. I did accepted it as a fact of nature. That's where we need Cage. He says: &quot;Silence is whatever sound to me&quot;. There's no such thing about what he says affectively. Like silence is a backdrop of what you hear in a certain sense. He thinks of noise as a characteristic sounds of certain kind of things. There are things that are musical instruments, making harmonic relations, ostensibly remanation of resonance, dissonance and assonance. That noise is some kind of value, and there it does play a kind of role - the sound of what normally has been excluded. By John Cage, it achieves as avant-gardicity. That's the avant-garde thing. And that's a representational state, it represents the world. Cage's music occurs that, world as noise in Cage's music. Making music is an induction in fact. Theses sounds organize this way in this direction. Call it music in a time T. Within that music, i'm thinking about the complexity, the fact that the music says it's recorded music, and you're sitting in front of La Sorbonne listening to your iPad. That music was made somewhere, it's the sound of another place. You have all these dis-locations relations to sound like that. I'm not so deeply concerned with the instrumental applications of phenomenal effects, characteristics of the organizations of sound under the rubric of music, to think of music as a political instrument. I do think on the other hand it's possible through music to express things that politic can not express. That's what i do and i call it Expressive Abstraction.</p>
      <p><strong>It's very distinctive from Cage approach.</strong></p>
      <p>I owe a lot to Cage, but it's not a question to improve his theory, his beauty amount  on a theoretical level,  or something like that. It's a question of his theory goes along with explaining his music - i want to his to explain music explained on my terms. I don't think any of his theory is negated by mine in any sort of sense. My terms are not what to his terms via negativa, but that's only because his music sounds the way it does, is made from the stuff that is made of and comes from where it comes. He and i have some cultural differences, equals differences, original differences, …. about classicism and whether or not music theory is bankrupt. (…)  <br />

        A lot of his theoretical statements belong to the world, not so much to the theory of music. Music as an art in a cultural spirit dominated by modernism and modernist formalism. Modernist formalism was on his last fuckin way. And they were really tired. And the minimalism, artists like Donald Judd, started to beat modernism up by taking its language litterally. And conceptualism as kind of an equivalent amongst propositions. Now we have a situation, which has always been the case, that art is a popular idea.</p>
      <p><strong>Red Krayola, at the contrary of Cage, embraced pop and rock music…</strong></p>
      <p>I don't think the conditions existed for him to be anything other than what we'd call an art composer. Like Philip Glass, Steve Reich or Charlemagne Palestine.<br />
        I'm more akin to someone like Jean-Jacques Perrey than John Cage. Because i've been playing the commercial pop music game. And my idea of pop music is whatever people are interested in. And the argument about punk… Punk rock was made as a popular music movement. Cage rejected it on the first instance. In NY, SF or L.A.. And it spreaded in very characteristics way in different places.  Right now, it doesn't seem there's any potential for coalescence, maybe. I'm definitely pursuing the idea in music and in art, those represent tendencies of the popularization of the idea of music are a new product in fact It's a product of the fact that the authority in the 60's could no longer sit on people anymore. To control would be to reach the point of distribution, and maintain chaos in production - i love chaos in production, that's my thing. To me Cage's music in its logic connects more to Fluxus. I have some affinities with Fluxus and dadaism, but certain dadaists, not all of them! Not the general tendencie. I like Picabia, i like Duchamp. Duchamp has more to do with what i think than Cage. I'm thinking about objects. I like Cage and i like music because there's a phenomenal effect. The body gets plaid. And there's a certain point in which you could say: everybody's sharing the experience with this sound. Whether they are listening to it or not.</p>
      <p><strong>You were also a pioneer of punk…</strong></p>
      <p>I happened to be at the right place in the right time! I was in London at that time and from that perspective i gotta know people, that was the perfect moment for me to spread my ideas. We were made to each other. (laughs) Actually, i was waiting for it to happen! Geoff Travis, the founder of Rough Trade, was doing Dj gigs and people were trusting his taste in music. DJ then was the real deal. Then come reggae and black and white music. I liked that a lot. Political and social peace of mind.</p>
      <p><strong>Do you think music still has the ability to subvert?</strong></p>
      <p>What do you want to subvert? On a fundamental list, everything left<br />
        Recognizing what is potential to the material as it sticks. By now, we have many voices, from the highly trained to the (?) untrained. We have musicians from virtuosity to poverty of talent. We have more and more people on all levels of fame; &quot;Hey, i can do that!&quot; That's all good. Locally, i think that's wonderful cause i don't think there's anything i can do about it (laughs) I don't think there's anything to subvert in that. Why you can install some sort of higher sense of order,<br />
        You can take all cicumstances and make statements<br />
        (???)<br />
        Do you think there's too much evil in the world? I wouldn't answer that question.<br />
        (???)</p>
      <p>My favourite Cage record of all is <em>Indeterminacy</em>. And i think it sums up this problem in a nutshell. Music happens somewhere, and it happens sometimes. And it can be more than one voice. And the sense of time, the brain is understanding senses of time. The question is: is the brain amused by these relations? Is there any fun in this?<br />
        You read the anecdots that appear of his book: David Tudor performs a score, but once it's recorded, the indeterminacy is over. Not anything indeterminate, it's all fixed. The indeterminacy is how the story stands to play another score. Cage is reading every story within two minutes, some faster, some a little bit slower. Two minutes happens to be a time of a pop song in 1950. He is a clever, brillant man.</p>
      <p><strong>Nowadays, all music melt together, whether it's from the 50's or from yesterday.</strong></p>
      <p>It's always been the case. We know the history of some of the things that we're interested in, and some other things we have no ideas where they came from. And sometimes it doesn't make a blinded difference. There's a song i like called <em>Green Door, </em>i have no idea who made this song, but i know i like it. Diachronicity is an issue. You wanna make something in the perception of it. Shown into the idea of association to other people in a potentially activist relation. So you want to motivate people to think something. You could it by referring on a ray of things that are already there or you can make a synthesis of your very own. There's so many ways to do it. But what happens is you introduce into this dream of already existing stuff, it's a world of data; And some of this data is already information.</p>
      <p><strong>But we're not in the continuum of history anymore…</strong></p>
      <p>I don't think you can say we're not in the historical continuum anymore. Historical continuum exists when we think of it. <br />
        'cause we're all working on the same problem all day long, we're trying to crack the existential nut. And also it's possible in the same time to have a little bit of fun and enjoy ourselves. The question is: there's some people out there managing information and trading (treating?) it under the rubric of knowledge. There are qualities and experts telling you exactly what's going on and interpretating it, inviting you to interprate details in a certain way to arrive at a certain view or sense of it. France had Descartes and Pascal - that's an interesting player - then coming forward you have Roland Barthes, then Foucault, Derrida and don't forget Bataille. Your culture is great in this kind of stuff. Duchamp was right about readymades. Everything's a goddamn' readymade. Culture is readymade. Its produces is readymade. Its functions specific,  i doubt there's many cases in the world of people going: &quot;Hey, let's have a barbecue! Where are my Red Krayola records?&quot; (laughs) I hope that happens someday! That's what i mean about popular music.</p>
      <p><strong>What about the death of modernism?</strong></p>
      <p>We all come from modernism. Culture is transmuting, transitioning, processing modernist ideas. The enlightenment is still very much with us, don't get me wrong.<br />
        From my point of view, postmodernism, which is maybe the last movement so to speak, was processing modernism, same ideas, under different premices.<br />
        Now we have people who are ignorant of the history. And who didn't perceive historical materialism fashion. I see there's a certain gesture of people who get involved in production. You can try that gesture but you won't stay there for long. Is that what you said out to me? You gonna have trouble maintaining a primitive state of mind.</p>
      <p><strong>Don't you think capitalism is a history eraser, responsible of a collective amnesy?</strong></p>
      <p>No, it doesn't. I don't think capitalism is especially responsible for erasing anything. Capitalism in fact makes artifacts out of computation (?), making money out of it.<br />
        It's a system of value. The capitalist sort of problem… We're worried about this commodity relation. There's some pure cultural entity. The only thing capitalism has to be punished for and need to be digestized and disciplined, is for the material relation of labour it depends on. The way it treats people. The way it manages peoples life is the goddamn problem. It's not what it does to cultural entities. I don't care. Then you get contaminated and that's all there is to it. You get indexed upon, there's appropriated people that use stuff assymetrically out of concept that they got to relate on. I don't care. There's nothing to do against this anyway. It's gonna happen. All i can do is to make something that resists the reductions that are operative right now.</p>
      <p><strong>I'd be interested to hear about your current collaboration with Art &amp; Language… </strong></p>
      <p>The collaboration with Art &amp; Language has always been like a conversation. There's two forms of semi-autonomous practices: visual arts and music, and the association of those two things in the cultural spiritation immediately enter into the realm of politics, and the politics of both associations. They had to deal with some strict lunacy, and rock n roll, and i've had to connect the institute connection. These critical association has been good for both organizations. It's been a healthy exchange of fluids relation. The politics that we share - we don't need to sit down to write some kind of politic manifesto- , is one of the reason we go along so well together. <br />
        They don't have much of a program. Their program is to figure out how to go on today, how to go on in relation to this or that exhibition, this or that problem, or whatever. And it takes a generative relation to it, of course. They do produce a genuine work out of a situation that come to them, themselves. And they shape these things. (…) The difference is that Red Krayola is a small business.<br />
        They have an exhibition this month in Barcelona. They gonna do an ad nominem attack in the style of Red Krayola. We had the texts and we performed them during the Whitney Biennal. We recorded the event and sent the result to them and they're gonna play it. It's gonna be projected behind themselves, and they gonna stand in front of it. And they will give voice to those ad nominem attacks. There's a quality to the expression which informs a kind of attitude to the band. The text is very important to be understood and heard. They will read the text in this legible matter. That will be the performance. We will be there virtually!</p>
